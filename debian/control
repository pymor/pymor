Description: makes pyMOR importable system-wide + dependency tracking
  pyMOR is a software library developed at the University of Münster for building model order reduction applications
  with the Python programming language. Its main focus lies on the application of reduced basis methods to
  parameterized partial differential equations. All algorithms in pyMOR are formulated in terms of abstract interfaces
  for seamless integration with external high-dimensional PDE solvers. Moreover, pure Python implementations of finite
  element and finite volume discretizations using the NumPy/SciPy scientific computing stack are provided for getting
  started quickly.
