    """Compare U and V for almost equality.

    The vectors of `U` and `V` are compared in pairs for almost equality.
    Two vectors `u` and `v` are considered almost equal iff

       ||u - v|| <= atol + ||v|| * rtol.

    The norm to be used can be specified via the `norm` or `product`
    parameter.

    If the length of `U` (`U_ind`) resp. `V` (`V_ind`) is 1, the one
    specified vector is compared to all vectors of the other array.
    Otherwise, the lengths of both indexed arrays have to agree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    U, V
        |VectorArrays| to be compared.
    U_ind, V_ind
        Indices of the vectors that are to be compared (see |VectorArray|).
    product
        If specified, use this scalar product |Operator| to compute the norm.
        `product` and `norm` are mutually exclusive.
    norm
        If specified, must be a callable, which is used to compute the norm
        or one of the string 'l1', 'l2', 'sup', in which case the respective
        |VectorArray| norm methods are used. `product` and `norm` are mutually
        exclusive. If neither is specified, `norm='l2'` is assumed.
    rtol
        The relative tolerance.
    atol
        The absolute tolerance.
