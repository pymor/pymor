    """Interface for |Parameter| dependent discrete operators.

    An operator in pyMOR is simply a mapping which for any given
    |Parameter| maps vectors from its `source` |VectorSpace|
    to vectors in its `range` |VectorSpace|.

    Note that there is no special distinction between functionals
    and operators in pyMOR. A functional is simply an operator with
    |NumpyVectorSpace| `(1)` as its `range` |VectorSpace|.

    Attributes
    ----------
    solver_options
        If not `None`, a dict which can contain the following keys:

        :'inverse':           solver options used for
                              :meth:`~OperatorInterface.apply_inverse`
        :'inverse_adjoint':   solver options used for
                              :meth:`~OperatorInterface.apply_inverse_adjoint`
        :'jacobian':          solver options for the operators returned
                              by :meth:`~OperatorInterface.jacobian`
                              (has no effect for linear operators)

        If `solver_options` is `None` or a dict entry is missing
        or `None`, default options are used.
        The interpretation of the given solver options is up to
        the operator at hand. In general, values in `solver_options`
        should either be strings (indicating a solver type) or
        dicts of options, usually with an entry `'type'` which
        specifies the solver type to use and further items which
        configure this solver.
    linear
        `True` if the operator is linear.
    source
        The source |VectorSpace|.
    range
        The range |VectorSpace|.
    H
