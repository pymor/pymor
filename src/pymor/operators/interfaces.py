    """Interface for |Parameter| dependent discrete operators.

    Every operator is viewed as a map ::

        A(Î¼): R^s -> R^r

    Note that there is no special distinction between functionals
    and operators in pyMOR. A functional is simply an operator with
    range dimension 1 and |NumpyVectorArray| as `range.type`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    invert_options
        |OrderedDict| of possible options for :meth:`~OperatorInterface.apply_inverse`.
        Each key is a type of inversion algorithm which can be used to invert the
        operator. `invert_options[k]` is a dict containing all options along with
        their default values which can be set for algorithm `k`. We always have
        `invert_options[k]['type'] == k` such that `invert_options[k]` can be passed
        directly to :meth:`~OperatorInterface.apply_inverse()`.
    linear
        `True` if the operator is linear.
    source
        The source |VectorSpace|.
    range
        The range |VectorSpace|.

        Denote `self` by A. Given a scalar product ( â, â), and vectors b_1, ..., b_N,

        In particular, if the c_i are orthonormal w.r.t. the given product,
        then A_P is the coordinate representation w.r.t. the b_i/c_i bases
        of the restriction of A to span(b_i) concatenated with the orthogonal
        projection onto span(c_i).

        From another point of view, if A is viewed as a bilinear form
        (see :meth:`~OperatorInterface.apply2`) and ( â, â ) is the Euclidean
        product, then A_P represents the matrix of the bilinear form restricted
        span(b_i) / spanc(c_i) (w.r.t. the b_i/c_i bases).

        How the projected operator is realized will depend on the implementation
        of the operator to project.  While a projected |NumpyMatrixOperator| will
        again be a |NumpyMatrixOperator|, only a

        source_basis
            The b_1, ..., b_N as a |VectorArray| or `None`. If `None`, no restriction of

            The c_1, ..., c_M as a |VectorArray|. If `None`, no projection in the range
            space is performed.
        product
            An |Operator| representing the scalar product.  If `None`, the

        name
