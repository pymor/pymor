class OperatorInterface(ImmutableInterface, Parametric, Named):
    '''Interface for |Parameter| dependent discrete operators.

    Every operator is viewed as a map ::

        A(μ): R^s -> R^r

    Note that there is no special distinction between functionals
    and operators in pyMOR. A functional is simply an operator with
    range dimension 1 and |NumpyVectorArray| as `type_range`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    dim_source
        The dimension s of the source space.
    dim_range
        The dimension r of the range space.
    invert_options
        |OrderedDict| of possible options for :meth:`~OperatorInterface.apply_inverse`.
        Each key is a type of inversion algorithm which can be used to invert the
        operator. `invert_options[k]` is a dict containing all options along with
        their default values which can be set for algorithm `k`. We always have
        `invert_options[k]['type'] == k` such that `invert_options[k]` can be passed
        directly to :meth:`~OperatorInterface.apply_inverse()`.
    linear
        `True` if the operator is linear.
    type_source
        The |VectorArray| class representing vectors of the source space.
    type_range
        The |VectorArray| class representing vectors of the range space.

        Parameters
        ----------
        U
            |VectorArray| of vectors to which the operator is applied.
        ind
            The indices of the vectors in `U` to which the operator shall be
            applied. (See the |VectorArray| documentation for further details.)
        mu

            A.apply2(V, U) = V^T*M*U

        Parameters
        ----------
        V
            |VectorArray| of the left arguments V.
        U
            |VectorArray| of the right right arguments U.
        V_ind
            The indices of the vectors in `V` to which the operator shall be

        U_ind

        mu

        product
            The scalar product used in the expression `(V, A(U))` given as
            an |Operator|.  If `None`, the euclidean product is chosen.
        pairwise
            If `False`, the 2-form is applied to all combinations of vectors
            in `V` and `U`, i.e. ::

                L.apply2(V, U).shape = (len(V_ind), len(U_ind)).

            If `True`, the vectors in `V` and `U` are applied in pairs, i.e.

        ----------

            The indices of the vectors in `U` to which the operator shall be

        mu
            The |Parameter| for which to evaluate the inverse operator.
        options
            Dictionary of options for the inversion algorithm. The dictionary
            has to contain the key `'type'` whose value determines which inversion
            algorithm is to be used. All other items represent options specific to
            this algorithm.  `options` can also be given as a string, which is then
            interpreted as the type of inversion algorithm. If `options` is `None`,
            a default algorithm with default options is chosen.  Available algorithms
            and their default options are provided by

            the jacobian.

        This method may only be called on linear functionals, i.e. linear operators

        or on operators describing vectors, i.e. linear operators with

        In the case of a functional, the identity ::

        ----------

        -------
        V
            |VectorArray| of length 1 containing the vector representation. We have
            `V.dim == self.dim_source`, `type(V) == self.type_source` for functionals

        How this linear combiniation is realized will depend on the operators involved.
        E.g. calling `lincomb` on a |NumpyMatrixBasedOperator| and only providing
        such operators will result in a new |NumpyMatrixBasedOperator| that will assemble
        to a |NumpyMatrixOperator|, whereas for arbitrary operators,
        :class:`pymor.operators.basic.LincombOperator` will be returned.

        The linear coefficients may be provided as scalars or |ParameterFunctionals|.
        Alternatively, if no linear coefficients are given, the missing coefficients become
        part of the |Parameter| the combinded |Operator| expects.

        A default implementation is provided in |OperatorBase|.

        Parameters
        ----------
        operators
            List of |Operators| whose linear combination is formed.
        coefficients
            `None` or a list of linear coefficients.
        num_coefficients
            If `coefficients` is `None`, the number of linear coefficients (starting
            at index 0) which are given by the |Parameter| component with name
            `'coefficients_name'`. The missing coefficients are set to `1`.
        coefficients_name
            If `coefficients` is `None`, the name of the |Parameter| component providing
            the linear coefficients.
        name
            Name of the new operator.

    @abstractmethod
    def projected(self, source_basis, range_basis, product=None, name=None):
        '''Project operator to subspaces of the source and range space.

        Denote `self` by A. Given a scalar product ( ⋅, ⋅), and vectors b_1, ..., b_N,
        c_1, ..., c_M, the projected operator A_P is defined by ::

            [ A_P(e_j) ]_i = ( c_i, A(b_j) )

        for all i,j, where e_j denotes the j-th canonical basis vector of R^N.

        In particular, if the c_i are orthonormal w.r.t. the given product,
        then A_P is the coordinate representation w.r.t. the b_i/c_i bases
        of the restriction of A to span(b_i) concatenated with the orthogonal
        projection onto span(c_i).

        From another point of view, if A is viewed as a bilinear form
        (see :meth:`~OperatorInterface.apply2`) and ( ⋅, ⋅ ) is the Euclidean
        product, then A_P represents the matrix of the bilinear form restricted
        span(b_i) / spanc(c_i) (w.r.t. the b_i/c_i bases).

        How the projected operator is realized will depend on the implementation
        of the operator to project.  While a projected |NumpyMatrixOperator| will
        again be a |NumpyMatrixOperator|, only a
        :class:`pymor.operators.basic.ProjectedOperator` will be returned
        in general. (Note that the latter will not be suitable to obtain an
        efficient offline/online-decomposition for reduced basis schemes.)

        A default implementation is provided in |OperatorBase|.

        .. warning::
            No check is performed whether the b_i and c_j are orthonormal or linear
            independent.

        Parameters
        ----------
        source_basis
            The b_1, ..., b_N as a |VectorArray| or `None`. If `None`, no restriction of
            the source space is performed.
        range_basis
            The c_1, ..., c_M as a |VectorArray|. If `None`, no projection in the range
            space is performed.
        product
            An |Operator| representing the scalar product.  If `None`, the
            Euclidean product is chosen.
        name
            Name of the projected operator.

        Returns
        -------
        The projected |Operator|.
