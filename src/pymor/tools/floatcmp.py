       Numpy's :meth:`~numpy.allclose` method uses the same definition but
       treats arrays containing infinities as close if the infinities are
       at the same places and all other entries are close.
       In our definition, arrays containing infinities can never be close
       which seems more appropriate in most cases.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y
        |NumPy arrays| to be compared. Have to be broadcastable to the same shape.
    rtol
        The relative tolerance.
    atol
        The absolute tolerance.
