    """Mesh a |DomainDescription| or an already existing Gmsh GEO-file using the Gmsh mesher.

    Parameters
    ----------
    domain_description
        A |DomainDescription| of the |PolygonalDomain| or |RectDomain| to discretize. Has to be `None`
        when `geo_file` is given.
    geo_file
        File handle of the Gmsh Geo-file to discretize. Has to be `None` when
        `domain_description` is given.
    geo_file_path
        Path of the created Gmsh GEO-file. When meshing a |PolygonalDomain| or |RectDomain| and
        `geo_file_path` is `None`, a temporary file will be created. If `geo_file` is specified, this
        is ignored and the path to `geo_file` will be used.
    msh_file_path
        Path of the created Gmsh MSH-file. If `None`, a temporary file will be created.
    mesh_algorithm
        The mesh generation algorithm to use (meshadapt, del2d, front2d).
    clscale
        Mesh element size scaling factor.
    options
        Other options to control the meshing procedure of Gmsh. See
        http://geuz.org/gmsh/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html#Command_002dline-options for all available options.
    refinement_steps
        Number of refinement steps to do after the initial meshing.

    Returns
    -------
    grid
        The generated :class:`~pymor.discretizers.builtin.grids.gmsh.GmshGrid`.
    boundary_info
        The generated :class:`~pymor.discretizers.builtin.grids.gmsh.GmshBoundaryInfo`.
