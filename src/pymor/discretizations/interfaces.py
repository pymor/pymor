    Attributes
    ----------
    solution_space
        |VectorSpace| of the |VectorArrays| returned by solve.
    linear
        `True` if the discretization describes a linear Problem.
    operators
        Dictionary of all |Operators| contained in the discretization.
        (Compare the implementation of :func:`pymor.reductors.basic.reduce_generic_rb`.)
    functionals
        Same as `operators` but for |Functionals|.
    vector_operators
        Same as operators but for |Operators| representing vectors, i.e.
        linear |Operators| with `source.dim == 1`.
    products
        Same as |Operators| but for inner product operators associated with the
