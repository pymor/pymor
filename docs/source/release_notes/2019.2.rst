pyMOR 2019.2 (December 16, 2019)
--------------------------------
We are proud to announce the release of pyMOR 2019.2! For this release we have
worked hard to make implementing new models and reduction algorithms with pyMOR
even easier. Further highlights of this release are an extended VectorArray
interface with generic support for complex numbers, vastly extended and
improved system-theoretic MOR methods, as well as builtin support for model
outputs and parameter sensitivities.

Over 700 single commits have entered this release. For a full list of changes
see `here <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/compare/0.5.x...2019.2.x>`__.

pyMOR 2019.2 contains contributions by Linus Balicki, Dennis Eickhorn and Tim
Keil. See `here <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/blob/main/AUTHORS.md>`__ for
more details.


Release highlights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Implement new models and reductors more easily
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As many users have been struggling with the notion of `Discretization` in pyMOR
and to account for the fact that not every full-order model needs to be a discretized
PDE model, we have decided to rename `DiscretizationInterface` to
:class:`~pymor.models.interfaces.ModelInterface` and all deriving classes accordingly
`[#568] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/568>`_. Consequently, the variable names
`m`, `rom`, `fom` will now be found throughout pyMOR's code to refer to an arbitrary
|Model|, a reduced-order |Model| or a full-order |Model|.

Moreover, following the `Zen of Python's <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`_
'Explicit is better than implicit' and 'Simple is better than complex', we have
completely revamped the implementation of |Models| and :mod:`~pymor.reductors`
to facilitate the implementation of new model types and reduction methods
`[#592] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/592>`_. In particular, the complicated
and error-prone approach of trying to automatically correctly project the |Operators|
of any given |Model| in `GenericRBReductor` and `GenericPGReductor` has been replaced
by simple |Model|-adapted reductors which explicitly state with which bases each
|Operator| shall be projected. As a consequence, we could remove the `operators` dict
and the notion of `special_operators` in :class:`~pymor.models.basic.ModelBase`,
vastly simplifying its implementation and the definition of new |Model| classes.


Extended VectorArray interface with generic complex number support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The :class:`~pymor.vectorarrays.interfaces.VectorArrayInterface` has been extended to
allow the creation of non-zero vectors using the
:meth:`~pymor.vectorarrays.interfaces.VectorArrayInterface.ones` and
:meth:`~pymor.vectorarrays.interfaces.VectorArrayInterface.full` methods
`[#612] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/612>`_. Vectors with random values can
be created using the :meth:`~pymor.vectorarrays.interfaces.VectorArrayInterface.random`
method `[#618] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/618>`_. All |VectorArray|
implementations shipped with pyMOR support these new interface methods.
As an important step to improve the support for system-theoretic MOR methods with
external PDE solvers, we have implemented facilities to provide generic support
for complex-valued |VectorArrays| even for PDE solvers that do not support complex
vectors natively `[#755] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/755>`_.


Improved and extended support for system-theoretic MOR methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To increase compatibility between input-output models in
:mod:`~pymor.models.iosys` and the |InstationaryModel|, support for models with
parametric operators has been added
`[#626] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/626>`_, which also enables
implementation of parametric MOR methods for such models.
Furthermore, the `state_space` attribute was removed in favor of
`solution_space` `[#648] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/648>`_ to make
more explicit the result of the
:meth:`~pymor.models.interfaces.ModelInterface.solve` method.
Further improvements in naming has been renaming attributes `n`, `m`, and `p` to
`order`, `input_dim`, and `output_dim`
`[#578] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/578>`_ and the `bode` method to
:meth:`~pymor.models.iosys.InputOutputModel.freq_resp`
`[#729] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/729>`_.
Reductors in :mod:`~pymor.reductors.bt` and :mod:`~pymor.reductors.h2` received
numerous improvements (`[#656] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/656>`_,
`[#661] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/661>`_,
`[#807] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/807>`_) and variants of one-sided
IRKA have been added `[#579] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/579>`_.
As for Lyapunov equations, a low-rank solver for Riccati equations has been
added `[#736] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/736>`_.


Model outputs and parameter sensitivities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The notion of a |Model|'s output has been formally added to the
:class:`~pymor.models.interfaces.ModelInterface` `[#750] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/750>`_:
The output of a |Model| is defined to be a |VectorArray| of the model's
:attr:`~pymor.models.interfaces.ModelInterface.output_space` |VectorSpace| and
can be computed using the new :meth:`~pymor.models.interfaces.ModelInterface.output` method.
Alternatively, :meth:`~pymor.models.interfaces.ModelInterface.solve` method can
now be called with `return_output=True` to return the output alongside the state space
solution.

To compute parameter sensitivities, we have added `d_mu` methods to
:meth:`OperatorInterface <pymor.operators.interfaces.OperatorInterface.d_mu>` and
:meth:`ParameterFunctionalInterface <pymor.parameters.interfaces.ParameterFunctionalInterface.d_mu>`
which return the partial derivative with respect to a given parameter component
`[#748] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/748>`_.


Additional new features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Extended FEniCS bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FEniCS support has been improved by adding support for nonlinear |Operators| including
an implementation of :meth:`~pymor.operators.interfaces.OperatorInterface.restricted`
to enable fast local evaluation of the operator for efficient
:class:`empirical interpolation <pymor.operators.ei.EmpiricalInterpolatedOperator>`
`[#819] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/819>`_. Moreover the parallel implementations
of :meth:`~pymor.vectorarrays.interfaces.VectorArrayInterface.amax` and
:meth:`~pymor.vectorarrays.interfaces.VectorArrayInterface.dofs` have been fixed
`[#616] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/616>`_ and
:attr:`~pymor.operators.interfaces.OperatorInterface.solver_options` are now correctly
handled in :meth:`~pymor.operators.interfaces.OperatorInterface._assemble_lincomb`
`[#812] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/812>`_.



Improved greedy algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
pyMOR's greedy algorithms have been refactored into :func:`~pymor.algorithms.greedy.weak_greedy`
and :func:`~pymor.algorithms.adaptivegreedy.adaptive_weak_greedy` functions that
use a common :class:`~pymor.algorithms.greedy.WeakGreedySurrogate` to estimate
the approximation error and extend the greedy bases. This allows these functions to be
used more flexible, e.g. for goal-oriented basis generation, by implementing a new
:class:`~pymor.algorithms.greedy.WeakGreedySurrogate` `[#757] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/757>`_.


Numerical linear algebra algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By specifying `return_R=True`, the :func:`~pymor.algorithms.gram_schmidt.gram_schmidt`
algorithm can now also be used to compute a QR decomposition of a given |VectorArray|
`[#577] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/577>`_. Moreover,
:func:`~pymor.algorithms.gram_schmidt.gram_schmidt` can be used as a more accurate
(but often more expensive) alternative for computing the :func:`~pymor.algorithms.pod.pod` of
a |Vectorarray|. Both, the older method-of-snapshots approach as well as the QR decomposition
are now available for computing a truncated SVD of a |VectorArray| via the newly added
:mod:`~pymor.algorithms.svd_va` module `[#718] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/718>`_.
Basic randomized algorithms for approximating the image of a linear |Operator| are
implemented in the :mod:`~pymor.algorithms.randrangefinder` module
`[#665] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/665>`_.


Support for low-rank operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Low-rank |Operators| and as well as sums of arbitrary |Operators| with a low-rank
|Operator| can now be represented by :class:`~pymor.operators.constructions.LowRankOperator`
and :class:`~pymor.operators.constructions.LowRankUpdatedOperator`. For the latter,
:meth:`~pymor.operators.interfaces.OperatorInterface.apply_inverse` and
:meth:`~pymor.operators.interfaces.OperatorInterface.apply_inverse_adjoint` are implemented
via the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula `[#743] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/743>`_.


Improved string representations of pyMOR objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Custom  `__str__` special methods have been implemented for all |Model| classes shipped with
pyMOR `[#652] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/652>`_. Moreover, we have added a generic
`__repr__` implementation to `BasicInterface` which recursively prints all class attributes
corresponding to an `__init__` argument (with a non-default value)
`[#706] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/706>`_.


Easier working with immutable objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A new check in :class:`~pymor.core.interfaces.ImmutableMeta` enforces all `__init__` arguments
of an |immutable| object to be available as object attributes, thus ensuring that
`~pymor.core.interfaces.ImmutableInterface.with_` works reliably with all |immutable| objects
in pyMOR `[#694] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/694>`_. To facilitate the initialization
of these attributes in `__init__` the
`__auto_init <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/732/files#diff-9ff4f0e773ee7352ff323cb88a3adeabR149-R164>`_
method has been added to `BasicInterface` `[#732] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/732>`_.
Finally, `~pymor.core.interfaces.ImmutableInterface.with_` now has a `new_type` parameter
which allows to change the class of the object returned by it
`[#705] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/705>`_.


project and assemble_lincomb are easier to extend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In pyMOR 0.5, we have introduced |RuleTables| to make central algorithms in
pyMOR, like the projection of an |Operator| via |project|, easier to trace and
extend.
For pyMOR 2019.2, we have further simplified |project| by removing the `product`
argument from the underlying |RuleTable| `[#785] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/785>`_.
As the inheritance-based implementation of `assemble_lincomb` was showing similar
complexity issues as the old inheritance-based implementation of `projected`, we
moved all backend-agnostic logic into the |RuleTable|-based free function
:func:`~pymor.algorithms.lincomb.assemble_lincomb`, leaving the remaining backend
code in :meth:`~pymor.operators.interfaces.OperatorInterface._assemble_lincomb`
`[#619] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/619>`_.


Improvements to pyMOR's discretization toolbox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
pyMOR's builtin discretization toolbox as seen multiple minor improvements:

- `[#821] Enable to have parametric dirichlet in fv <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/821>`_
- `[#687] Discretizing robin boundary conditions on a RectGrid <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/687>`_
- `[#691] Remove 'order' arguments from CG operators <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/691>`_
- `[#760] [discretizers.cg] affine decomposition of robin operator and rhs functionals <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/760>`_
- `[#793] Use meshio for Gmsh file parsing <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/793>`_


Backward incompatible changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dropped Python 3.5 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As Python 3.6 or newer now ships with the current versions of all major Linux distributions,
we have decided to drop support for Python 3.6 in pyMOR 2019.2. This allows us to benefit
from new language features, in particular f-strings and class attribute definition order
preservation `[#553] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/553>`_,
`[#584] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/553>`_.


Global RandomState
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
pyMOR now has a (mutable) global default :class:`~numpy.random.RandomState`. This means
that when :meth:`~pymor.parameters.spaces.CubicParameterSpace.sample_randomly` is called
repeatedly without specifying a `random_state` or `seed` argument, different |Parameter|
samples will be returned in contrast to the (surprising) previous behavior where the
same samples would have been returned. The same :class:`~numpy.random.RandomState` is
used by the newly introduced :meth:`~pymor.vectorarrays.interfaces.VectorArrayInterface.random`
method of the :class:`~pymor.vectorarrays.interfaces.VectorArrayInterface`
`[#620] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/620>`_.


Space id handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The usage of |VectorSpace| :attr:`ids <pymor.vectorarrays.interfaces.VectorSpace.id>` in pyMOR
has been reduced throughout pyMOR to avoid unwanted errors due to incompatible |VectorSpaces|
(that only differ by their id):

- `[#611] [models.iosys] remove space id handling except for factory methods <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/611>`_
- `[#613] Remove VectorSpace id handling from projection methods <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/613>`_
- `[#614] Remove id from BlockVectorSpace <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/614>`_
- `[#615] Remove 'space' parameter from as_vector <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/615>`_


Further API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The stagnation criterion of the :func:`~pymor.algorithms.newton.newton` is disabled by default
  (and a relaxation parameter has been added) `[#800] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/800>`_.
- The `coordinates` parameter of :class:`~pymor.parameters.functionals.ProjectionParameterFunctional`
  has been renamed to `index` `[#756] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/756>`_.
