Release highlights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FEniCS and deal.II support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
pyMOR now includes wrapper classes for integrating PDE solvers
written with the `dolfin` library of the `FEniCS <https://fenicsproject.org>`_
project. For a usage example, see :meth:`pymordemos.thermalblock_simple.discretize_fenics`.
Experimental support for `deal.II <https://dealii.org>`_ can be
found in the `pymor-deal.II <https://github.com/pymor/pymor-deal.II>`_
repository of the pyMOR GitHub organization.


Parallelization of pyMOR's reduction algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have added a parallelization framework to pyMOR which allows
parallel execution of reduction algorithms based on a simple
|WorkerPool| interface `[#14] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/14>`_.
The :meth:`~pymor.algorithms.greedy.greedy` `[#155] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/155>`_
and :meth:`~pymor.algorithms.ei.ei_greedy` algorithms `[#162] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/162>`_
have been refactored to utilize this interface.
Two |WorkerPool| implementations are shipped with pyMOR:
:class:`~pymor.parallel.ipython.IPythonPool` utilizes the parallel
computing features of `IPython <https://ipython.org/>`_, allowing
parallel algorithm execution in large heterogeneous clusters of
computing nodes. :class:`~pymor.parallel.mpi.MPIPool` can be used
to benefit from existing MPI-based parallel HPC computing architectures
`[#161] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/161>`_.


Support classes for MPI distributed external PDE solvers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While pyMOR's |VectorArray|, |Operator| and `Discretization`
interfaces are agnostic to the concrete (parallel) implementation
of the corresponding objects in the PDE solver, external solvers
are often integrated by creating wrapper classes directly corresponding
to the solvers data structures. However, when the solver is executed
in an MPI distributed context, these wrapper classes will then only
correspond to the rank-local data of a distributed |VectorArray| or
|Operator|.

To facilitate the integration of MPI parallel solvers, we have added
MPI helper classes `[#163] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/163>`_
in :mod:`pymor.vectorarrays.mpi`, :mod:`pymor.operators.mpi`
and :mod:`pymor.discretizations.mpi` that allow an automatic
wrapping of existing sequential bindings for MPI distributed use.
These wrapper classes are based on a simple event loop provided
by :mod:`pymor.tools.mpi`, which is used in the interface methods of
the wrapper classes to dispatch into MPI distributed execution
of the corresponding methods on the underlying MPI distributed
objects.

The resulting objects can be used on MPI rank 0 (including interactive
Python sessions) without any further changes to pyMOR or the user code.
For an example, see :meth:`pymordemos.thermalblock_simple.discretize_fenics`.


New reduction algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- :meth:`~pymor.algorithms.adaptivegreedy.adaptive_greedy` uses adaptive
  parameter training set refinement according to :cite:`HDO11` to prevent
  overfitting of the reduced model to the training set `[#213] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/213>`_.

- :meth:`~pymor.reductors.parabolic.reduce_parabolic` reduces linear parabolic
  problems using :meth:`~pymor.reductors.basic.reduce_generic_rb` and
  assembles an error estimator similar to :cite:`GP05`, :cite:`HO08`.
  The :mod:`~pymordemos.parabolic_mor` demo contains a simple sample
  application using this reductor `[#190] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/190>`_.

- The :meth:`~pymor.algorithms.image.estimate_image` and
  :meth:`~pymor.algorithms.image.estimate_image_hierarchical` algorithms
  can be used to find an as small as possible space in which the images of
  a given list of operators for a given source space are contained for all
  possible parameters `mu`. For possible applications, see
  :meth:`~pymor.reductors.residual.reduce_residual` which now uses
  :meth:`~pymor.algorithms.image.estimate_image_hierarchical` for
  Petrov-Galerkin projection of the residual operator `[#223] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/223>`_.


Copy-on-write semantics for |VectorArrays|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The :meth:`~pymor.vectorarrays.interfaces.VectorArrayInterface.copy` method
of the |VectorArray| interface is now assumed to have copy-on-write
semantics. I.e., the returned |VectorArray| will contain a reference to the same
data as the original array, and the actual data will only be copied when one of
the arrays is changed. Both |NumpyVectorArray| and |ListVectorArray| have been
updated accordingly `[#55] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/55>`_.
As a main benefit of this approach, |immutable| objects having a |VectorArray| as
an attribute now can safely create copies of the passed |VectorArrays| (to ensure
the immutability of their state) without having to worry about unnecessarily
increased memory consumption.


Improvements to pyMOR's discretizaion tookit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- An unstructured triangular |Grid| is now provided by :class:`~pymor.grids.unstructured.UnstructuredTriangleGrid`.
  Such a |Grid| can be obtained using the :meth:`~pymor.domaindiscretizers.gmsh.discretize_gmsh`
  method, which can parse `Gmsh <https://gmsh.info/>`_ output files. Moreover, this
  method can generate `Gmsh` input files to create unstructured meshes for
  an arbitrary :class:`~pymor.domaindescriptions.polygonal.PolygonalDomain`
  `[#9] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/9>`_.

- Basic support for parabolic problems has been added.
  The :meth:`~pymor.discretizers.parabolic.discretize_parabolic_cg` and
  :meth:`~pymor.discretizers.parabolic.discretize_parabolic_fv` methods can
  be used to build continuous finite element or finite volume `Discretizations`
  from a given :class:`pymor.analyticalproblems.parabolic.ParabolicProblem`.
  The :mod:`~pymordemos.parabolic` demo demonstrates the use of these methods
  `[#189] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/189>`_.

- The :mod:`pymor.discretizers.disk` module contains methods to create stationary and
  instationary affinely decomposed `Discretizations` from matrix data files
  and an `.ini` file defining the given problem.

- :class:`EllipticProblems <pymor.analyticalproblems.elliptic.EllipticProblem>`
  can now also contain advection and reaction terms in addition to the diffusion part.
  :meth:`~pymor.discretizers.cg.discretize_elliptic_cg` has been
  extended accordingly `[#211] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/211>`_.

- The :mod:`continuous Galerkin <pymor.operators.cg>` module has been extended to
  support Robin boundary conditions `[#110] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/110>`_.

- :class:`~pymor.functions.bitmap.BitmapFunction` allows to use grayscale
  image data as data |Functions| `[#194] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/194>`_.

- For the visualization of time-dependent data, the colorbars can now be
  rescaled with each new frame `[#91] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/91>`_.


Caching improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- `state id` generation is now based on deterministic pickling.
  In previous version of pyMOR, the `state id` of |immutable| objects
  was computed from the state ids of the parameters passed to the
  object's `__init__` method. This approach was complicated and error-prone.
  Instead, we now compute the `state id` as a hash of a deterministic serialization
  of the object's state. While this approach is more robust, it is also
  slightly more expensive. However, due to the object's immutability,
  the `state id` only has to be computed once, and state ids are now only
  required for storing results in persistent cache regions (see below).
  Computing such results will usually be much more expensive than the
  `state id` calculation `[#106] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/106>`_.

- :class:`CacheRegions <pymor.core.cache.CacheRegion>` now have a
  :attr:`~pymor.core.cache.CacheRegion.persistent` attribute indicating
  whether the cache data will be kept between program runs. For persistent
  cache regions the `state id` of the object for which the cached method is
  called has to be computed to obtain a unique persistent id for the given object.
  For non-persistent regions the object's
  `~pymor.core.interfaces.BasicInterface.uid` can be used instead.
  :attr:`pymor.core.cache_regions` now by default contains `'memory'`,
  `'disk'` and `'persistent'` cache regions
  `[#182] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/182>`_, `[#121] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/121>`_ .

- |defaults| can now be marked to not affect `state id` computation.
  In previous version of pyMOR, changing any |default| value caused
  a change of the `state id` pyMOR's defaults dictionary, leading to cache
  misses. While this in general is desirable, as, for instance, changed linear
  solver default error tolerances might lead to different solutions for
  the same `Discretization` object, it is clear for many I/O related defaults,
  that these will not affect the outcome of any computation. For these defaults,
  the :meth:`~pymor.core.defaults.defaults` decorator now accepts a `sid_ignore`
  parameter, to exclude these defaults from `state id` computation, preventing
  changes of these defaults causing cache misses `[#81] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/81>`_.

- As an alternative to using the :meth:`@cached <pymor.core.cache.cached>`
  decorator, :meth:`~pymor.core.cache.CacheableInterface.cached_method_call`
  can be used to cache the results of a function call. This is now used
  in :meth:`~pymor.discretizations.interfaces.DiscretizationInterface.solve`
  to enable parsing of the input parameter before it enters the cache key
  calculation `[#231] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/231>`_.


Additional new features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- :meth:`~pymor.operators.interfaces.OperatorInterface.apply_inverse_adjoint` has been added to the |Operator| interface `[#133] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/133>`_.

- Support for complex values in |NumpyVectorArray| and |NumpyMatrixOperator| `[#131] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/131>`_.

- New :class:`~pymor.parameters.functionals.ProductParameterFunctional`.
    This |ParameterFunctional| represents the product of a given list of
    |ParameterFunctionals|.

- New :class:`~pymor.operators.constructions.SelectionOperator` `[#105] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/105>`_.
    This |Operator| represents one |Operator| of a given list of |Operators|,
    depending on the evaluation of a provided |ParameterFunctional|,

- New block matrix operators `[#215] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/215>`_.
    :class:`~pymor.operators.block.BlockOperator` and
    :class:`~pymor.operators.block.BlockDiagonalOperator` represent block
    matrices of |Operators| which can be applied to appropriately shaped
    :class:`BlockVectorArrays <pymor.vectorarrays.block.BlockVectorArray>`.

- `from_file` factory method for |NumpyVectorArray| and |NumpyMatrixOperator| `[#118] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/118>`_.
    :meth:`NumpyVectorArray.from_file <pymor.vectorarrays.numpy.NumpyVectorArray.from_file>` and
    :meth:`NumpyMatrixOperator.from_file <pymor.operators.numpy.NumpyMatrixOperator.from_file>`
    can be used to construct such objects from data files of various formats
    (MATLAB, matrix market, NumPy data files, text).

- |ListVectorArray|-based |NumpyMatrixOperator| `[#164] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/164>`_.
    The :mod:`~pymor.playground` now contains
    :class:`~pymor.playground.operators.numpy.NumpyListVectorArrayMatrixOperator`
    which can apply |NumPy|/|SciPy| matrices to a |ListVectorArray|.
    This |Operator| is mainly intended for performance testing purposes.
    The :mod:`~pymordemos.thermalblock` demo now has an option
    `--list-vector-array` for using this operator instead of |NumpyMatrixOperator|.

- Log indentation support `[#230] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/230>`_.
    pyMOR's log output can now be indented via the `logger.block(msg)`
    context manger to reflect the hierarchy of subalgorithms.

- Additional `INFO2` and `INFO3` log levels `[#212] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/212>`_.
    :mod:`Loggers <pymor.core.logger>` now have additional `info2`
    and `info3` methods to highlight important information (which does
    fall in the 'warning' category).

- Default implementation of :meth:`~pymor.operators.interfaces.OperatorInterface.as_vector` for functionals `[#107] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/107>`_.
    :meth:`OperatorBase.as_vector <pymor.operators.basic.OperatorBase>` now
    contains a default implementation for functionals by calling
    :meth:`~pymor.operators.interfaces.OperatorInterface.apply_adjoint`.

- `pycontracts` has been removed as a dependency of pyMOR `[#127] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/127>`_.

- Test coverage has been raised to 80 percent.


Backward incompatible changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- |VectorArray| implementations have been moved to the :mod:`pymor.vectorarrays` sub-package `[#89] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/89>`_.

- The `dot` method of the |VectorArray| interface has been split into :meth:`~pymor.vectorarrays.interfaces.VectorArrayInterface.dot` and :meth:`~pymor.vectorarrays.interfaces.VectorArrayInterface.pairwise_dot` `[#76] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/76>`_.
    The `pairwise` parameter of :meth:`~pymor.vectorarrays.interfaces.VectorArrayInterface.dot`
    has been removed, always assuming `pairwise == False`. The method
    :meth:`~pymor.vectorarrays.interfaces.VectorArrayInterface.pairwise_dot`
    corresponds to the `pairwise == True` case. Similarly the `pariwise` parameter
    of the :meth:`~pymor.operators.interfaces.OperatorInterface.apply2` method
    of the |Operator| interface has been removed and a
    :meth:`~pymor.operators.interfaces.OperatorInterface.pairwise_apply2` method
    has been added.

- `almost_equal` has been removed from the |VectorArray| interface `[#143] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/143>`_.
    As a replacement, the new method :meth:`pymor.algorithms.basic.almost_equal`
    can be used to compare |VectorArrays| for almost equality by the norm
    of their difference.

- `lincomb` has been removed from the |Operator| interface `[#83] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/83>`_.
    Instead, a |LincombOperator| should be directly instantiated.

- Removal of the `options` parameter of :meth:`~pymor.operators.interfaces.OperatorInterface.apply_inverse` in favor of :attr:`~pymor.operators.interfaces.OperatorInterface.solver_options` attribute `[#122] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/122>`_.
    The `options` parameter of :meth:`OperatorInterface.apply_inverse <pymor.operators.interfaces.OperatorInterface.apply_inverse>`
    has been replaced by the :attr:`~pymor.operators.interfaces.OperatorInterface.solver_options`
    attribute. This attribute controls which fixed (linear) solver options are
    used when :meth:`~pymor.operators.interfaces.OperatorInterface.apply_inverse` is
    called. See `here <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/184>`__ for more details.

- Renaming of reductors for coercive problems `[#224] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/224>`_.
    :meth:`pymor.reductors.linear.reduce_stationary_affine_linear` and
    :meth:`pymor.reductors.stationary.reduce_stationary_coercive` have been
    renamed to :meth:`pymor.reductors.coercive.reduce_coercive` and
    :meth:`pymor.reductors.coercive.reduce_coercive_simple`. The old names
    are deprecated and will be removed in pyMOR 0.5.

- Non-parametric objects have now `~pymor.parameters.base.Parametric.parameter_type` `{}` instead of `None` `[#84] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/84>`_.

- Sampling methods of |ParameterSpaces| now return iterables instead of iterators `[#108] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/108>`_.

- Caching of :meth:`~pymor.discretizations.interfaces.DiscretizationInterface.solve` is now disabled by default `[#178] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/178>`_.
    Caching of :meth:`~pymor.discretizations.interfaces.DiscretizationInterface.solve`
    must now be explicitly enabled by using
    :meth:`pymor.core.cache.CacheableInterface.enable_caching`.

- The default value for `extension_algorithm` parameter of :meth:`~pymor.algorithms.greedy.greedy` has been removed `[#82] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/82>`_.

- Changes to :meth:`~pymor.algorithms.ei.ei_greedy` `[#159] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/159>`_, `[#160] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/160>`_.
    The default for the `projection` parameter has been changed from `'orthogonal'`
    to `'ei'` to let the default algorithm agree with literature. In
    addition a `copy` parameter with default `True` has been added.
    When `copy` is `True`, the input data is copied before executing
    the algorithm, ensuring, that the original |VectorArray| is left
    unchanged. When possible, `copy` should be set to `False` in order
    to reduce memory consumption.

- The `copy` parameter of :meth:`pymor.algorithms.gram_schmidt.gram_schmidt` now defaults to `True` `[#123] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/123>`_.

- `with_` has been moved from `BasicInterface` to `ImmutableInterface` `[#154] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/154>`_.

- `BasicInterface.add_attributes` has been removed `[#158] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/158>`_.

- Auto-generated names no longer contain the :attr:`~pymor.core.interfaces.BasicInterface.uid` `[#198] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/198>`_.
    The auto-generated `~pymor.core.interfaces.BasicInterface.name`
    of pyMOR objects no longer contains their
    `~pymor.core.interfaces.BasicInterface.uid`. Instead, the name
    is now simply set to the class name.

- Python fallbacks to Cython functions have been removed `[#145] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/issues/145>`_.
    In order to use pyMOR's discretization toolkit, building of the
    :mod:`~pymor.grids._unstructured`, :mod:`~pymor.tools.inplace`,
    :mod:`~pymor.tools.relations` Cython extension modules is now
    required.
