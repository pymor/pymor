pyMOR 2020.2 (December 10, 2020)
--------------------------------
We are proud to announce the release of pyMOR 2020.2! This release extends pyMOR's
support for non-intrusive model reduction via artificial neural networks to
non-stationary models. Built-in support for computing parameter sensitivities
simplifies the use of pyMOR in PDE-constrained optimization applications.
pyMOR's documentation has been extended by three new tutorials, and all tutorial
code can now easily be executed using `binder <https://mybinder.org>`_.

Over 520 single commits have entered this release. For a full list of changes
see `here <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/compare/2020.1.x...2020.2.x>`__.

pyMOR 2020.2 contains contributions by Tim Keil and Hendrik Kleikamp.
See `here <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/blob/main/AUTHORS.md>`__ for
more details.


Release highlights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parameter derivatives of solutions and outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In `[#1110] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1110>`_ tools for
PDE-constrained parameter optimization were added. These include parameter derivatives
of the solutions and the output of a |Model|. In particular,
:meth:`~pymor.models.interface.Model.solve_d_mu` can now be used to compute partial
parameter derivatives. Moreover, :meth:`~pymor.models.interface.Model.output_d_mu`
can be used to compute the parameter gradient of the output using the
derivatives of the solutions. Alternatively, for a |StationaryModel| and a linear output, an
adjoint variable can be used to speed up the computation of the gradient
(see :meth:`~pymor.models.basic.StationaryModel._compute_output_d_mu`).


Neural network reductor for non-stationary problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A reductor based on neural networks which deals with non-stationary problems was
added in `[#1120] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1120>`_. The implementation is an
extension of the already existing approach for stationary problems in pyMOR.
Here, the time component is treated as an ordinary parameter. The usage of
the newly introduced reductor is presented in a corresponding demo where a Burgers'
type equation is solved. As in the stationary case, the implementation allows for
several customizations regarding the network architecture and training parameters.

To make training of neural networks more robust, the available data is now shuffled
randomly before splitting it into training and validation set
`[#1175] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1175>`_.


New tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A new tutorial on :doc:`using pyMOR for accelerating the solution of linear PDE-constrained
optimization problems <../tutorial_optimization>` has been added
with `[#1205] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1205>`_.
This tutorial showcases the new features added in `[#1110] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1110>`_
and also discusses general questions on using model order reduction for a class of optimization problems.

The tutorial :doc:`'Projecting a Model' <../tutorial_projection>` explains how to use pyMOR to build an
online-efficient reduced order model via (Petrov-)Galerkin projection onto a given reduced space
`[#1084] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1084>`_.
Alongside the mathematical foundation, the user is introduced to the core elements of
pyMOR's internal architecture that realize the projection.

A tutorial on :doc:`linear time-invariant systems <../tutorial_lti_systems>` was added
and the existing :doc:`balanced truncation tutorial <../tutorial_bt>` was appropriately simplified
`[#1141] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1141>`_.

All tutorials now include a 'launch binder' button which allows to directly
run the tutorial code in the web browser `[#1181] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1181>`_.

In order to consolidate our documentation all remaining Jupyter notebooks from the `notebooks/`
directory were converted to demo scripts `[#1160] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1160>`_,
and the `notebooks/` directory was removed `[#1198] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1198>`_.



Additional new features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bode plot for input-output systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The :meth:`~pymor.models.iosys.InputOutputModel.bode_plot` method for creating a
Bode plot was added `[#1051] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1051>`_,
complementing the :meth:`~pymor.models.iosys.InputOutputModel.mag_plot` method.
Additionally, the :meth:`~pymor.models.iosys.InputOutputModel.bode` method can
be used to compute the magnitudes and phases over the imaginary axis (for
continuous-time systems).


Iterable VectorArrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
|VectorArrays| became iterable sequences with
`[#1068] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1068>`_, i.e.,
`for v in V` can be used to work on individual vectors
(i.e. |VectorArray| views of length 1) when needed.


Expansion of ConcatenationOperators and improved projection algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The new :meth:`~pymor.algorithms.simplify.expand` allows to recursively
expand :class:`concatenations <pymor.operators.constructions.ConcatenationOperator>`
of |LincombOperators| in any given |Model| or |Operator|
`[#1098] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1098>`_.
In particular, :meth:`~pymor.algorithms.simplify.expand` is now used
in :meth:`~pymor.algorithms.projection.project` to improve the projection of
such constructs `[#1102] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1102>`_.
Moreover, several minor improvements have been made to
:meth:`~pymor.algorithms.projection.project_to_subbasis`
`[#1138] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1138>`_.


Support for Python 3.9
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- `[#1128] Enable publishing wheels for and running CI on Python 3.9 <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1128>`_



Backward incompatible changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Updated Model interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To make the simultaneous computation of multiple |Model| output quantities such as internal state,
output, or error estimates more efficient and better customizable a :meth:`~pymor.models.interface.Model.compute`
method was added to the |Model| interface which is now responsible for the computation of all
relevant data that can be gathered from the simulation of a |Model|
`[#1113] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1113>`_.
Existing interface methods such as :meth:`pymor.models.interface.Model.solve` or
or :meth:`pymor.models.interface.Model.output` now act as convenience frontends for
:meth:`~pymor.models.interface.Model.compute`.
Existing custom |Models| have to be adapted to the new architecture.

The `estimate` method has been renamed to :meth:`~pymor.model.interface.Model.estimate_error`
`[#1041] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1041>`_.
The old method is deprecated and will be removed in the next release.

Further, to simplify interoperability with third-party packages,
the model outputs, i.e., the results of :meth:`~pymor.models.interface.output`,
are no longer generic |VectorArrays|, but NumPy arrays.
For consistency, `input_space` and `output_space` were removed and
`input_dim` and `output_dim` were renamed to `dim_input` and `dim_output`
in :class:`~pymor.models.iosys.InputOutputModel`
`[#1089] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1089>`_.



Changes in methods for inner products and norms of VectorArrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At first, |VectorArrays| only had `dot` and `pairwise_dot` methods for computing
inner products between vectors.
Later, more general methods `inner` and `pairwise_inner` were added to simplify
computing non-Euclidean inner products.
To reduce the list of methods for |VectorArrays|,
the `dot` and `pairwise_dot` methods are now deprecated and will be removed in
the next release `[#1066] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1066>`_.
In the same vein, the `l2_norm` and `l2_norm2` methods are deprecated in favor
of `norm` and `norm2` `[#1075] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1075>`_
Finally, due to lack of usage and support in some external PDE solvers, the
`l1_norm` method was deprecated
`[#1070] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1070>`_.


Restructuring of grid classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The inheritance structure of grid classes was simplified
`[#1044] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1044>`_.
In particular,

- `ConformalTopologicalGridDefaultImplementations`,
  `ReferenceElementDefaultImplementations`,
  `AffineGridDefaultImplementations`, and
  `ConformalTopologicalGrid`
  were removed,
- `AffineGrid` was renamed to `Grid`,
- `AffineGridWithOrthogonalCenters` was renamed to `GridWithOrthogonalCenters`.


Renaming of some Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For consistency in the naming of |Operators|,
`ComponentProjection`, `Concatenation` and `LinearAdvectionLaxFriedrichs` were
renamed to `ComponentProjectionOperator`, `ConcatenationOperator` and
`LinearAdvectionLaxFriedrichsOperator`, respectively
`[#1046] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1046>`_.


Minimal pip and Manylinux wheel version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to reduce special casing and infrastructure investment needed for
maintaining compatibility with older versions we decided to
increase the minimal required pip version to 19.0 (released Jan '19) and decided to no longer publish manylinux1 wheels.
Pip 19.0 already understands the Manylinux 2010 tag, which going further is the oldest platform we will ship wheels
for.
