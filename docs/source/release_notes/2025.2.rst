Main new features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data-driven reductors and VKOGA algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In `[#2498] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/2498>`_,
we implemented a :class:`~pymor.reductors.data_driven.DataDrivenReductor` that can
be used to approximate the solution or the output of a model as a parametric
quantity by training a machine learning surrogate. The reductor can be used for
stationary and instationary problems (in the latter case, it is possible to treat
time as an additional input for the machine learning or consider a time-vectorized
version predicting a whole trajectory at once). Furthermore, it is now possible to
apply different machine learning methods, such as neural networks (still implemented
in pyMOR using PyTorch), kernel methods (purely |NumPy|-based implementation available
in pyMOR as well, see description below) or any regressor from scikit-learn.
For convenience, we implemented a
:class:`~pymor.reductors.data_driven.DataDrivenPODReductor` that computes a reduced
basis from snapshot data using proper orthogonal decomposition and performs the
orthogonal projection of the training snapshots onto the reduced basis in order to
generate the required training data for the machine learning surrogate.
The `NeuralNetworkReductor` was removed entirely but its behavior can be replicated
using the :class:`~pymor.reductors.data_driven.DataDrivenPODReductor` in combination
with the :class:`~pymor.algorithms.ml.nn.regressor.NeuralNetworkRegressor`.
Many details on the ML-based reductor and its usage are given in
the respective :doc:`../tutorial_mor_with_ml`.

In `[#2484] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/2484>`_, the vectorial kernel
orthogonal greedy algorithm (VKOGA) was implemented. The selection of interpolation
centers is performed using pyMOR's :meth:`~pymor.algorithms.greedy.weak_greedy`.
The interpolant is extended efficiently using a Newton basis and a Cholesky
decomposition of the kernel matrix.
The :class:`~pymor.algorithms.ml.vkoga.regressor.VKOGARegressor` can be used similar
to other scikit-learn regressors as machine learning surrogate in the
:class:`~pymor.reductors.data_driven.DataDrivenReductor`. In addition, it can also
be applied independent of model order reduction as surrogate in regression of
vector-valued data, see for instance the demo scripts :mod:`~pymordemos.vkoga`
and :mod:`~pymordemos.vkoga_2d_input`.
