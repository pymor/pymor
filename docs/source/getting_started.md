# Getting Started

pyMOR includes a variety of model order reduction methods
for different types of models.
We illustrate how to use pyMOR on two basic examples and
give pointers to further documentation.

## Installation

pyMOR can be installed via `pip`. To follow this guide, pyMOR should be installed with GUI support:

```bash
pip install pymor[gui]
```

If you follow along in a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebook, you should install pyMOR using
the `jupyter` extra:

```bash
pip install pymor[jupyter]
```

We also provide [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org) packages.
For further details see [README.md](https://github.com/pymor/pymor/blob/main/README.md).

## Reduced Basis Method for Elliptic Problem

Here we show how to reduce a parametric linear elliptic problem using the Reduced Basis (RB) method.
As an example we use a standard 2x2 thermal-block problem,
which is given by the elliptic equation

$$
-\nabla \cdot [d(x, \mu) \nabla u(x, \mu)] = 1
$$

on the domain $[0, 1]^2$ with Dirichlet zero boundary values.
The domain is partitioned into 2x2 blocks and
the diffusion function $d(x, \mu)$ is constant
on each such block $i$ with value $\mu_i$.

```
(0,1)---------(1,1)
|        |        |
|  μ_2   |  μ_3   |
|        |        |
|------------------
|        |        |
|  μ_0   |  μ_1   |
|        |        |
(0,0)---------(1,0)
```

After discretization, the model has the form

$$
(L + \mu_0 L_0 + \mu_1 L_1 + \mu_2 L_2 + \mu_3 L_3) u(\mu) = f
$$

We can obtain this discrete full-order model in pyMOR using the
{func}`~pymor.models.examples.thermal_block_example` function
from the {mod}`pymor.models.examples` module:

```{code-cell}
from pymor.models.examples import thermal_block_example

fom_tb = thermal_block_example()
```

This uses pyMOR's {mod}`builtin discretization toolkit <pymor.discretizers.builtin>`
to construct the model.
In the {doc}`builtin-discretizer tutorial <tutorial_builtin_discretizer>` you learn how
to define your own models using this toolkit.

`fom_tb` is an instance of {{StationaryModel}}, which encodes the mathematical structure
of the model through its {{Operators}}:

```{code-cell}
fom_tb
```

Its parameters can also be accessed:

```{code-cell}
fom_tb.parameters
```

Let us show the solution for particular parameter values:

```{code-cell}
mu = [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1]
U = fom_tb.solve(mu)
fom_tb.visualize(U)
```

To construct a reduced-order model using the reduced basis method,
we first need to create a {mod}`reductor <pymor.reductors>` which projects
the model onto a given reduced space:

```{code-cell}
from pymor.parameters.functionals import ExpressionParameterFunctional
from pymor.reductors.coercive import CoerciveRBReductor

reductor = CoerciveRBReductor(
    fom_tb,
    product=fom_tb.h1_0_semi_product,
    coercivity_estimator=ExpressionParameterFunctional('min(diffusion)',
                                                       fom_tb.parameters)
)
```

We use here {class}`~pymor.reductors.coercive.CoerciveRBReductor`, which
also assembles an a posterior error estimator for the error w.r.t. the
$H^1_0$-seminorm.
For that estimator, an parameter-dependent lower bound for the coercivity constant
of the problem is provided as an {class}`~pymor.parameters.functionals.ExpressionParameterFunctional`.

Using this reductor and its error estimator, we can build a reduced space with corresponding
reduced-order model using a {func}`weak greedy <pymor.algorithms.greedy.rb_greedy>` algorithm:

```{code-cell}
from pymor.algorithms.greedy import rb_greedy

parameter_space = fom_tb.parameters.space(0.1, 1)
greedy_data = rb_greedy(fom_tb, reductor, parameter_space.sample_randomly(1000),
                        rtol=1e-2)
rom_tb = greedy_data['rom']
```

Here, the greedy algorithm operates on a randomly chosen set of 1000 training parameters from the
{{ParameterSpace}} of admissible parameter values returned by
{func}`~pymor.models.examples.thermal_block_example`.

We can see that the reduced-order model is also a `StationaryModel`,
but of lower order:

```{code-cell}
rom_tb
```

We can compute the reduced-order model's reconstructed solution
for the same parameter value and show the error:

```{code-cell}
Urom = rom_tb.solve(mu)
Urec = reductor.reconstruct(Urom)
fom_tb.visualize(U - Urec)
```

Finally, we check that the reduced-order model is indeed faster:

```{code-cell}
from time import perf_counter
tic = perf_counter()
fom_tb.solve(mu)
toc = perf_counter()
rom_tb.solve(mu)
tac = perf_counter()
print(f't_fom: {toc-tic}  t_rom: {tac-toc}  speedup: {(toc-tic)/(tac-toc)}')
```

## Balanced Truncation for LTI System

Here we consider a synthetic linear time-invariant (LTI) system of the form

$$
\begin{align*}
  \dot{x}(t) & = A x(t) + B u(t), \\
  y(t) & = C x(t),
\end{align*}
$$

where $x$ is the state, $u$ is the input, and $y$ is the output.

```{code-cell}
from pymor.models.examples import penzl_example

fom_lti = penzl_example()
```

The result is an {{LTIModel}}:

```{code-cell}
fom_lti
```

We can use the Bode plot to show the frequency response of the LTI system, i.e.,
to see which input frequencies are amplified and phase-shifted in the output:

```{code-cell}
w = (1e-1, 1e4)
_ = fom_lti.transfer_function.bode_plot(w)
```

Note that if you do not run this code in a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebook,
you probably need to manually show the plot:

```python3
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
plt.show()
```

We can run balanced truncation to obtain a reduced-order model.

```{code-cell}
from pymor.reductors.bt import BTReductor

bt = BTReductor(fom_lti)
rom_lti = bt.reduce(10)
```

The reduced-order model is again an {{LTIModel}}, but of lower order.

```{code-cell}
rom_lti
```

Looking at the error system, we can see which frequencies are well approximated.

```{code-cell}
err_lti = fom_lti - rom_lti
_ = err_lti.transfer_function.mag_plot(w)
```
