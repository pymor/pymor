pyMOR - Model Order Reduction with Python
=========================================

pyMOR is a software library for building model order reduction applications
with the Python programming language.  Its main focus lies on the application
of reduced basis methods to parameterized partial differential equations.  All
algorithms in pyMOR are formulated in terms of abstract interfaces for seamless
integration with external high-dimensional PDE solvers. Moreover, pure Python
implementations of finite element and finite volume discretizations using the
NumPy/SciPy scientific computing stack are provided for getting started
quickly.

**NOTE** pyMOR is still in early development.  Should you have any questions
regarding pyMOR or wish to contribute, do not hesitate to contact us!

Distribution Packages
---------------------

Packages for Ubuntu are available via our
[PPA](https://launchpad.net/~pymor/+archive/stable):

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:pymor/stable
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python-pymor

Daily snapshots are available via the 
[pymor/daily PPA](https://launchpad.net/~pymor/+archive/daily).

Demo applications and documentation are packaged separately:

    sudo apt-get install python-pymor-demos
    sudo apt-get install python-pymor-doc

The latter makes a `pymor-demo` script available, which can be used to run
all installed demos.


Installation via pip
--------------------

pyMOR can also easily be installed via the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
command:

    pip install [--user] pymor

This will install the latest release of pyMOR on your system. If you pass the
optional `--user` argument, pyMOR will only be installed for your local user,
not requiring administrator privileges. To install the latest development version
of pyMOR, execute

    pip install [--user] git+https://github.com/pymor

which will require that the [git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system is
installed on your system.

Note that pyMOR depends on [Cython](http://www.cython.org/), as well as the
[NumPy](http://numpy.org/) and [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) packages.
On all major Linux distributions, these packages can be easily installed
via the distribution's package manager. For Debian-based systems (e.g. Ubuntu),
the following command should work:

    sudo apt-get install cython python-pip python-numpy python-scipy

When not available on your system, pip will automatically build and
install these dependencies. This, however, will in turn require a full C/C++ compiler
toolchain and header files for several libraries (BLAS, etc.).

After installation of pyMOR, further optional packages will be suggested if
not already installed.  Some of these ([PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide),
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org), [pyopengl](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/),
[mpi4py](http://mpi4py.scipy.org/)) are again most easily installed
via your package manager. For Debian-based systems, try:

    sudo apt-get install python-pyside python-matplotlib python-opengl python-mpi4py

Again, all these dependencies can also be installed directly via pip.


Documentation
-------------

Documentation is available online at [Read the Docs](http://pymor.readthedocs.org/)
or offline in the `python-pymor-doc` package.

To build the documentation yourself, execute

    make doc
    
inside the root directory of the pyMOR source tree. This will generate HTML
documentation in `docs/_build/html`.


External PDE solvers
--------------------

pyMOR has been designed with easy integration of external PDE solvers
in mind.

A basic approach is to use the solver only to generate high-dimensional
system matrices which are then read by pyMOR from disk (`pymor.discretizers.disk`).
Another possibility is to steer the solver via an appropriate network
protocol. 

Whenever possible, we recommend to recompile the solver as a 
Python extension module which gives pyMOR direct access to the solver without 
any communication overhead. A basic example using 
[pybindgen](https://github.com/gjcarneiro/pybindgen) can be found in 
`src/pymordemos/minimal_cpp_demo`. A more elaborate nonlinear example
using [Boost.Python](http://www.boost.org/) can be found
[here](https://github.com/pymor/dune-burgers-demo). Moreover,
we provide bindings for the following solver libraries:

* [FEniCS](http://fenicsproject.org)

    MPI-compatible wrapper classes for dolfin linear algebra data structures are
    shipped with pyMOR (`pymor.vectorarrays.fenics`, `pymor.operators.fenics`).
    For an example see `pymordemos.thermalbock`, `pymordemos.thermalblock_simple`.

* [deal.II](https://dealii.org)

    Python bindings and pyMOR wrapper classes can be found
    [here](https://github.com/pymor/pymor-deal.II).

* [DUNE](https://www.dune-project.org)

    [dune-pymor](https://github.com/pymor/dune-pymor) automatically wraps
    [dune-hdd](https://users.dune-project.org/projects/dune-hdd/wiki) discretizations
    for use with pyMOR.

Do not hesitate to contact
[us](http://listserv.uni-muenster.de/mailman/listinfo/pymor-dev) if you
need help with the integration of your PDE solver.


Setting up an Environment for pyMOR Development
-----------------------------------------------

First make sure that all dependencies are installed. This can be easily
achieved by first installing pyMOR with its dependencies as described
above. Then uninstall the pyMOR package itself, e.g.

    sudo apt-get uninstall python-pymor

or

    pip uninstall pyMOR

Then, clone the pyMOR git repository using

    git clone https://github.com/pymor/pymor $PYMOR_SOURCE_DIR
    cd $PYMOR_SOURCE_DIR

and, optionally, switch to the branch you are interested in, e.g.

    git checkout 0.2.x

Then, add pyMOR to the search path of your Python interpreter, either by
setting PYTHONPATH

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYMOR_SOURCE_DIR/src:$PYTHONPATH

or by using a .pth file:

    echo "$PYMOR_SOURCE_DIR/src" > $PYTHON_ROOT/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pymor.pth

Here, PYTHON_ROOT is either '/usr', '$HOME/.local' or the root of your
[virtual environment](http://www.virtualenv.org/). Finally, build the Cython
extension modules as described in the next section.


Cython extension modules
------------------------

pyMOR uses [Cython](http://www.cython.org/) extension modules to speed up
numerical algorithms which cannot be efficiently expressed using NumPy idioms.
The source files of these modules (files with extension `.pyx`) have to be
processed by Cython into a `.c`-file which then must be compiled into a shared
object (`.so` file). The whole build process is handeled automatically by
`setup.py`.

If you want to develop Cython extensions modules for pyMOR yourself, you should
add your module to the `ext_modules` list defined in the `_setup` method of
`setup.py`. Calling

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

will then build the extension module and place it into your pyMOR source tree.


Tests
-----

pyMOR uses [pytest](http://pytest.org/) for unit testing. To run the test suite,
simply execute `make test` in the base directory of the pyMOR repository. This
will also create a test coverage report which can be found in the `htmlcov`
directory. Alternatively, you can run `make full-test` which will also enable
[pyflakes](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes) and
[pep8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) checks.

All tests are contained within the `src/pymortests` directory and can be run
individually by executing `py.test src/pymortests/the_module.py`.
